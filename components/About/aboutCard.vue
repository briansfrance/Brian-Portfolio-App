      deal of knowledge and expertise in design and coding into every
      project. Starting out with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design Brian
      has been able to move through tough terrain of the automotive advertising
      world as a hybrid role of design and website maintenance to a full Front
      End Developer. Over the past 6 years he went from not knowing any coding
      languages to helping build some beautiful user interface front ends. He
      started learning to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript to advance his career
      with OOMDO in 2015, this is where he found his real passion for coding.

      software applications desktop and mobile. His most proud application is

      Technology Inc. here Brian was hired to build a UI for a backend already
      built, he had to decide what language the front end would be built out in.

      taught himself React.js. Brian was the only Front End Developer on the
      team and did not have any help building the UI or resources to help coach
      him how to make sure it worked. He was able to, with his willingness to
      learn and adapt to new challenges was able to create an amazing UI for the
      client. The web application was getting a lot of traction before GE's
      inner politics stopped funding the project.<br /><br />While with LTI
      Brian was able to impress his superiors, in which one had left to join
      Advanced Information Management. This supervisor was so impressed he
      wanted to get Brian to join AIM. Brian once joining AIM was told he needed
      to learn Vue and Nuxt to help with all their products. He was able to
      successfully learn Vue &amp; Nuxt to help with multiple projects one being
      Ventur Real Estate a mobile application for interested consumers to
      connect and socialize with real estate agents through their social media

      was the lead and sole designer on the project and only one of two
      developers on the project build. Him and one other developer were able to
      build an entire application for mobile in a 6 month time frame, this is
      also the first mobile application built for Advanced Information
